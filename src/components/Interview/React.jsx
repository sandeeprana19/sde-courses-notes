                2. How do react lifecycle methods of class based components
                work?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-2">

                    A. Let's assume there is a parent class component which is
                    rendering 2 similar child class components so now let me
                    tell you how react lifecycle methods work in this scenario.
                    In react lifecycle methods, there are mainly 3 phases that
                    are mounting phase, updating phase & unmounting phase. And
                    all of these phases have render phase & commit phase. So
                    first of all, react starts with the lifecycle methods of
                    parent class component so it starts with the render phase
                    first where parent class component constructor is called &
                    then parent class component render is called & then when
                    react finds that parent class component is rendering 2
                    similar child class components then react batches the render
                    phase of both child class components. So now react start the
                    lifecycle methods of 1st & 2nd child class components
                    respectively where first child class component constructor
                    will be called & then first child class component render
                    will be called & then 2nd child class component constructor
                    will be called & then 2nd child class component render will
                    be called. So this is how the render phase will be completed
                    for both parent & child class components.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then react starts the commit phase where it batches the
                    commit phase of both child class components & then react
                    updates the DOM in a single phase for both child class
                    components & then 1st child class componentDidMount will be
                    called & then 2nd child class componentDidMount will be
                    called & then parent class componentDidMount will be called.
                    So this is how the mounting phase of the react lifecycle
                    methods works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And now let's say we've updated the state variable by
                    passing the fetched api data as an argument to setState
                    method within componentDidMount function of 1st child class
                    component then react will start updating phase of 1st child
                    class component where render will be called within render
                    phase & then react start the commit phase where it will
                    update the DOM in a single phase & then componentDidUpdate
                    will be called. So this is how the updating phase of the
                    react lifecycle methods works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And now let's say we've left the page and go to another page
                    then react will start the unmounting lifecycle where
                    componentWillUnmount will be called before we go to another
                    page.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So this is how the react lifecycle methods of class based
                    components works.

                3. What are react hooks?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <p>
                  A. React hooks are normal javascript functions which are given
                  to us by react and they're pre-build and the only thing is
                  that those functions comes with some super powers. Those
                  functions had some return logic written behind the scenes
                  inside react. Those functions are the utility functions given
                  to us by react. So there are multiple utility functions that
                  are known as react hooks. For example: useState, useEffect,
                  useContext, useReducer, useRef etc.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div className="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-200">
              <input type="radio" name="interview" />
              <div className="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                4. Define useState() hook? Describe it?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
                  <p>
                    A. An useState() hook basically generates super powerful
                    state variables and state updating function in react. So to
                    use it first of all, it needed to be named import from
                    react. And then as useState hook is again a function so
                    we'll can call it like a function & pass any argument as
                    initial value of state variable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then this useState hook return an array from which we'll
                    destructure two element like state variable and state
                    updating function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there is some use case of it like if we want to
                    update state variable then we just need to call state
                    updating function & then pass the update value as an
                    argument to it.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div className="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-200">
              <input type="radio" name="interview" />
              <div className="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                5. What is an useEffect hook? Describe it?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
                  <p>
                    A. An useEffect hook has its own specific arrow function and
                    dependency array. So to use it first of all, it needed to be
                    named import from react. And then as useEffect hook is again
                    a function so we’ll call it like a function which takes two
                    arguments so the first argument is an arrow function which
                    is a callback function and the second argument is a
                    dependency array.
                  </p>
                  <p>There're some use cases of useEffect hook like:</p>
                  <ol className="list-[lower-roman] pl-5 flex flex-col gap-y-2">
                    <li>
                      We can't call useEffect hook outside of react functional
                      component because react expect it to be call inside react
                      functional component instead of outside. But if we do so
                      then react will throw an error like "Invalid hook call".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If we don't pass dependency array then the callback
                      function will be call on every component render cycle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If we pass empty dependency array then the callback
                      function will be call once only after initial component
                      render & not after on every component render cycle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If we pass any state variable inside dependency array then
                      the callback function will be call once only after initial
                      component render & not after on every component render
                      cycle but it will only be call whenever the state variable
                      is updated.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <p>
                  A. Virtual DOM isn't an actual DOM as it is the representation
                  of actual DOM. So virtual DOM is basically those react
                  elements which is an object so similarly whenever we have a
                  big jsx structure it is all an object so this object is
                  basically known as react virtual DOM.
                </p>

            <div className="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-200">

                <p>
                  A. Diff algorithm basically finds out the difference between
                  two virtual DOMs that are updated virtual DOM and previous
                  virtual DOM.

                8. What is a Reconciliation Algorithm? or Can you tell me how
                does React's reconciliation algorithm work?

              <div className="collapse-content overflow-x-auto">
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
                  <p>
                    A. Reconciliation algorithm is also known as React Fiber
                    since the release of React 16. So let’s say we’ve a UI of
                    top rated restaurant button and restaurants container which
                    contain 10 restaurant cards so whenever react render this UI
                    it will create the virtual DOM which is actually the
                    representation of actual dom & then react keep this virtual
                    DOM with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then let’s say on click on that top rated restaurant
                    button react filter out top rated restaurants based on some
                    logic & then react will again create the updated virtual DOM
                    & keep it with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So at this moment diff algorithm comes into picture to find
                    out the difference between two virtual DOMs that is the
                    previous virtual DOM meaning the old virtual DOM before
                    restaurants filtered & updated virtual DOM meaning the new
                    virtual DOM after restaurants filtered & it will then
                    actually update the DOM on every render cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So basically, this reconciliation algorithm or react fiber
                    is the new way to find out the difference between two
                    virtual DOMs & update or manipulate the DOM efficiently on
                    every render cycle because this is the core job of react. So
                    this whole algorithm is known as a reconciliation algorithm.

                  A. A .env file is the short form for "environment file" which
                  is a simple text file and which is used to store environment
                  variables for react application. These environment variables
                  typically contain configuration settings such as API keys,
                  database connection strings, ports, or other sensitive or
                  environment-specific data.

                    A. CSS-in-JS allows us to write scoped, dynamic, and
                    component-based styles directly inside JavaScript for
                    improving maintainability, avoiding global conflicts, and
                    enabling conditional styling based on props or state.
                    Therefore, we need to do css in js.

                          several things like:

                          browser. So it includes several things like:

                  <p>
                    A. React class based component is the older way of creating
                    component in react. And it's a normal javascript class.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    React functional component is the newer way of creating
                    component in react. So it's just a normal javascript
                    function which return some piece of jsx code so that's all
                    is known as react functional component. So whenever we
                    create any react functional component create with a capital
                    letter otherwise we'll get an error because it's a react way
                    to understand that this is a react functional component.

                  <p>
                    A. So we can write async keyword before an arrow function
                    let say fetchData to make it async & then we'll write await
                    before fetch() which will await for data to come. And then
                    we'll call this fetchData arrow function inside the 1st
                    argument of useEffect hook which is the callback function
                    because this is best place to make an api call in react.

                <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
                  <p>
                    A. Props drilling is a situation in React where we pass
                    props from a parent component down to deeply nested child
                    components even if some intermediate components don’t need
                    that data themselves so just to get it to the final child.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <pre className="relative bottom-[1.4375rem] right-[10.625rem]">
                    <code>
                      {`
                        <App>
                          └── <Parent>
                                └── <Child>
                                      └── <GrandChild />
                    `}
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    Let say we've define deeply nested component like{" "}
                    <code>{`<App />`}</code> component and then inside that{" "}
                    <code>{`<App />`}</code> we've <code>{`<Parent />`}</code>{" "}
                    component and then inside that <code>{`<Parent />`}</code>{" "}
                    we've <code>{`<Child />`}</code> component & then inside
                    that <code>{`<Child />`}</code> we've{" "}
                    <code>{`<GrandChild />`}</code> component. So if{" "}
                    <code>{`<GrandChild />`}</code> needs some data from{" "}
                    <code>{`<App />`}</code> then we've to pass it through{" "}
                    <code>{`<Parent />`}</code> and <code>{`<Child />`}</code>{" "}
                    as props even if those components don’t use the data. So
                    that’s what we call it as props drilling in react.

                8. Let say we've component a, component b and component c then
                if we want to pass props from component a to component c so can
                we do it instead of using props drilling?

                    A. Yes, absolutely! If you want to pass props from Component
                    A to Component C without going through Component B, then you
                    can avoid props drilling by using React Context API or a
                    state management library like Redux.

                    A. Let's assume there is food ordering app where there is a
                    cart on header & there is food card on which it have add
                    button so now let me tell how the whole flow of redux
                    architecture works behind the scene.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So when we click on that add button it dispatches an action
                    which calls the reducer function which modifies the slices
                    of the redux store and because the header component is
                    subscribed to this store using a selector then cart data on
                    the header component will automatically be updated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So this is how the whole flows of redux architecture works

                  <p>
                    A. In React, the key prop is a special reserved prop which
                    is used to help React to identify which items in a list have
                    changed, added and removed. It helps in optimizing rendering
                    performance when working with dynamic lists.

                  <p>
                    A. Without a unique key, react re-render all items even if
                    most haven't changed. So with a key, react can efficiently
                    reuse existing elements and only update what's necessary.
                    Therefore, defining a key prop to the list items is
                    important in react.

                1. Can you explain the key differences between react class
                component and functional component with hook? When would you
                choose one over the other?
              </div>

                  <p>
                    A. React class component is the older way of creating
                    component in react. And it's a normal javascript class.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    React functional component is the newer way of creating
                    component in react. So it's just a normal javascript
                    function which return some piece of jsx code so that's all
                    is known as react functional component. So whenever we
                    create any react functional component create with a capital
                    letter otherwise we'll get an error because it's a react way
                    to understand that this is a component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For new development, I prefer react functional components
                    because they are cleaner, easier to maintain, and allow
                    logic reuse through custom hooks. However, react class
                    components are still used in legacy codebases.

                    <p>
                      For React unit testing, I usually use
                      @testing-library/react. And then let say I render the
                      contact component in a test DOM and then query element
                      like heading, and then assert it's presence with expect
                      function for checking if the contact page heading render.

                    <p>
                      Let’s say I’m testing a Contact component. Then I'll
                      create a file like Contact.test.js and then import render
                      and screen from @testing-library/react and then render the
                      contact component with render(
                      <code>{"<Contact />"}</code>
                      ). And then I'll use screen.getByRole("heading") to find
                      the heading and then store it in a heading variable and
                      then use an assertion like
                      expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument() to confirm it
                      rendered. This strategy focuses on testing components from
                      the user’s perspective, rather than their internal
                      implementation.

                      like Button or Card and then use them directly. For
                      branding, I wrap my app in ThemeProvider to customize
                      colors, typography, etc. It’s great for fast and
                      professional-looking UIs. But sometimes style overrides
                      can be tricky and the bundle can grow if not optimized.

                    review and tweak them for accuracy, but overall it speed up

                    A. One of the key techniques I used is code splitting with

                    I also leveraged bundlers like Vite/Webpack.

                    Apart from that, I always make sure to use a proper key prop
                    for a list items so that it helps in optimizing rendering
                    performance when working with dynamic lists. And I also look
                    at things like memoization for example React.memo, useMemo
                    and useCallback which helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
                    And I also look at things like debounce api calls in search
                    boxes.

                      I prefer rendering the UI first, then making the API call
                      in useEffect and then updating the state with the fetched
                      data. This way, users see the layout instantly and I avoid
                      blocking the initial render.

                8. Can you explain the concept of React hooks, an example of how

                    A. React hooks are normal javascript functions which are
                    given to us by react and they're pre-build and the only
                    thing is that those functions comes with some super powers.
                    Those functions had some return logic written behind the
                    scenes inside react. Those functions are the utility
                    functions given to us by react. So there are multiple
                    utility functions that are known as react hooks. For
                    example: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef
                    etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, let give you an example of this react hooks concept
                    which help me to solve specific problem in a project. So,
                    let say in one project I had to fetch API data when the
                    component mounted. So, I used useState hook to store the
                    fetched data and useEffect hook to handled the side effect
                    of fetching it on mount.

                    A. Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useRef help by
                    reducing unnecessary work. For example, useRef stores values
                    without triggering re-renders, and useEffect ensures
                    expensive code runs only when dependencies changes. On top
                    of that, useMemo and useCallback can be used to memoize
                    values and functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

                      State management helps to ensure I only re-render the
                      parts of the UI that actually need to change. By
                      structuring state properly and keeping it as local as
                      possible, I reduce unnecessary renders and improve app
                      performance.

                    <p>
                      State management plays a big role in performance because
                      every state change can trigger a re-render. If we store
                      too much state at a high level or share it unnecessarily,
                      it can cause many components to re-render, even if they
                      don’t need to.

                        Splitting large state objects into smaller, more focused
                        pieces.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In larger apps, using dedicated state management tools
                        like Redux Toolkit or Zustand to centralize and optimize
                        updates.

                      For example, in one dashboard project, moving a frequently

                      component cut the re-renders across the app by half.”

                11. Describe a useCases so let say I have an input text box.
                Now, you know, anything related to calling an API is an
                expensive operation, right? And I want to minimize it as much as
                possible. So you are putting in your input in text box and after
                you have completed putting the input in text box, then I want to
                call the API, right? So I want there to be some delay before you
                complete, you know completing your input text in the search text
                box. What is the technique of implementing that in React and how
                do you do it?

                    <p>
                      So in such case, I think I can use a technique like
                      debouncing with useEffect and setTimeout or a custom
                      useDebounce hook. So debouncing delays the API call until
                      the user stops typing for a set time, so that I avoid
                      sending a request for every keystroke.

                  </div>

                    <p>🔍 Expandable Version (if they ask for details):</p>
                    <p>
                      In React, frequent API calls on every keystroke can be
                      expensive. To optimize, so I can use debouncing — meaning,
                      wait until the user has stopped typing for a short delay
                      (e.g., 500ms) before triggering the API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Example: I can store the input in state with useState,
                      then use useEffect to watch that value. Inside, I'll start
                      a setTimeout to call the API after 500ms. If the user
                      types again before that delay ends, I’ll clear the timeout
                      with clearTimeout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This way, we only call the API once after the user pauses
                      typing, which reduces unnecessary network calls and
                      improves performance.

                          keystroke before firing an API call.

                    A. I have worked with TypeScript in React projects to add
                    strong typing, which helps in catching errors early and
                    makes the codebase easier to maintain and collaborate on.

                  <p>
                    For setting up TypeScript in a React project, nowadays I
                    prefer using Vite or Next.js, as Create React App is
                    deprecated.

                    <li>
                      With Vite, I can create a TypeScript React project using:
                      npm create vite@latest and select React + TypeScript
                      template.

                    <li>
                      For Next.js, I initialize the project with npx
                      create-next-app@latest, and if I select TypeScript,
                      Next.js automatically sets up the tsconfig.json and type
                      dependencies.

                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    After setup, I rename .js files to .tsx for components and
                    .ts for utility files. Then, I define interfaces or types
                    for component props, API responses, and application state.

                  <p>
                    I also configure strict TypeScript rules in tsconfig.json to
                    enforce better type safety. Throughout the project, I make
                    use of TypeScript features like optional types, generics,
                    and union types for better code predictability.
